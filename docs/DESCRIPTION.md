This mod adds ducks and geese to minecraft.
It works on both fabric and forge since it is powered by [geckolib] and [architectury].

If you encounter any bugs, please report them on the github issue tracker linked in this project.

## Requirements

You will need to install [geckolib] for this mod to work.
Additionally, on fabric, make sure you have [fabric-api][fabric-api-mr] installed.

## Features

#### Duck

- Can be bred with seeds.
- They lay eggs and drop feathers similar to chickens.
- Unlike chickens, they also like to swim in the water, groom themselves and dip their head into the water.
- Also, they dance when there is a music disc playing nearby!

##### Duck Sack

- You can craft a duck sack and use it to transport ducks similar to how you can bucket fish.

#### Goose

- They can be bred with all kinds of seeds similar to ducks.
- But they love kelp and seagrass even more, which you can use to tame them.
- Similar to dogs they will try to attack with you and defend you from attacking monsters.
- Once tamed you can sit them down and give them weapons.
- Geese know how to defend themselves. Once attacked they will remember and fight you in groups.
  - They will forgive you though when you give them food by right-clicking or throwing it to them.
- They will scare away illagers similar to how cats scare away creepers.
- Occasionally, they will try to steal the item in your hand.
  - They will happily exchange that for food though, so you don't have to kill them.

#####  Goose Foot

- Item dropped from geese.
- Can be used to brew a potion of intimidation that scares illagers away(**this only works in survival mode!**).
