This mod adds ducks and geese to minecraft.

It is powered by [geckolib] and [architectury] and works on both fabric and forge in version 1.16.

Even though I tested the mod alot it will be released as a beta at first until I am sure it is stable.
If you encounter any bugs, please report it on the github issue tracker linked in this project.

NOTE: You will need to install [geckolib-fabric] and [fabric-api] for this mod to work!

This is the fabric version of the mod. [For forge look here][udm-forge].

## Features

#### Duck
- They can be bred with seeds.
- They lay eggs and drop feathers similar to chickens.
- Unlike chickens they also like to swim in the water, groom themself and dip their head into the water.
- Also they dance when there is a music disc playing nearby!

##### Duck Sack
- You can craft a duck sack and use it to transport ducks similar to how you can bucket fish.

#### Goose
- They can be bred with all kinds of seeds similar to ducks.
- You can tame them using those! But they love kelp and seagrass even more.
- Similar to dogs they will try to attack with you and defend you from attacking monsters.
- Once tamed you can sit them down, give them weapons.
- Geese know how to defend themself and once attacked they will remember and fight you in groups.
- They will forgive you though when you give them food by right clicking or throwing it to them.
- They will scare away illagers similar to how cats scare away creepers.
- Rarely they will try to steal your item in your hand.
- They will happily exchange that for food though, so you don't have to kill them.

#####  Goose Foot
- Item dropped from geese.
- Can be used to brew potion of intimidation that scares illagers away(**this only works in survival mode!**).


Please don't ask for 1.16.4 compatibility. 1.16.4 mods will work in an 1.16.5 instance aswell so there is no reason
to run such an old version of minecraft anymore.
